/* PREFACE */

// i’m sure you noticed, but “JS” in the series title is not an abbreviation for words used to curse about JS
// though cursing at the language’s quirks is something we can probably all identify with!
// from the earliest days of the Web, JS has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume
// while flickering mouse trails and annoying pop-up prompts may be where JS started, nearly two decades later, the technology and capability of JS has grown many orders of magnitude
// and few doubt its importance at the heart of the world’s most widely available software platform: the Web
// but as a language, it has perpetually been a target for a great deal of criticism, owing partly to its heritage but even more to its design philosophy
// even the name evokes, as Brendan Eich once put it, “dumb kid brother” status next to its more mature older brother Java
// but the name is merely an accident of politics and marketing
// the two languages are vastly different in many important ways
// “JavaScript” is as related to “Java” as “Carnival” is to “Car”
// it is simultaneously a simple, easy-to-use language that has broad appeal, and a complex and nuanced collection of language mechanics that without careful study will elude true understanding even for the most seasoned of JS developers

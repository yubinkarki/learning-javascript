/* ARRAYS */

// as compared to other type-enforced languages, JS arrays are just containers for any type of value
// from string to number to object to even another array (which is how you get multidimensional arrays):
var a = [1, "2", [3]];

a.length; // 3
a[0] === 1; // true
a[2][0] === 3; // true

// you don’t need to presize your arrays, you can just declare them and add values as you see fit:
var b = [];

b.length; // 0
b[0] = 1;
b[1] = "2";
b[2] = [3];
b.length; // 3

// be careful about creating “sparse” arrays (leaving or creating empty/ missing slots):
var c = [];

c[0] = 1;
// no c[1] slot set here
c[2] = [3];

console.log("Accessing the first index of array c", c[1]); // undefined
console.log("Length of array c", c.length); // 3

// while that works, it can lead to some confusing behavior with the “empty slots” you leave in between
// while the slot appears to have the undefined value in it, it will not behave the same as if the slot is explicitly set (a[1] = undefined)
// arrays are numerically indexed (as you’d expect), but the tricky thing is that they also are objects that can have string keys/properties added to them (but which don’t count toward the length of the array):
var d = [];

d[0] = 1;
d["foobar"] = 2;

console.log("Length of array d", d.length); // 1
console.log(d["foobar"]); // 2
console.log(d.foobar); // 2

//hHowever, a gotcha to be aware of is that if a string value intended as a key can be coerced to a standard base-10 number
// then it is assumed that you wanted to use it as a number index rather than as a string key!

var e = [];
e["13"] = "hello";

console.log("Length of array e", e.length); // 14

// generally, it’s not a great idea to add string keys/properties to arrays
// use objects for holding values in keys/properties, and save arrays for strictly numerically indexed values

/* ARRAY-LIKES */

// there will be occasions where you need to convert an array-like value (a numerically indexed collection of values) into a true array
// usually so you can call array utilities (like indexOf(..), concat(..), forEach(..), etc.) against the collection of values
// one very common way to make such a conversion is to borrow the slice(..) utility against the value:
function foo() {
  console.log("Arguments", arguments); // { '0': 'bar', '1': 'baz' }
  var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  arr.push("bam");
  console.log("List of items", arr); //  [ 'bar', 'baz', 'bam' ]
}

foo("bar", "baz");

// if slice() is called without any other parameters, as it effectively is in the above snippet, the default values for its parameters have the effect of duplicating the array (or, in this case, array-like)
// as of ES6, there’s also a built-in utility called Array.from(..) that can do the same task:
function bar() {
  console.log("Arguments", arguments); // { '0': 'foo', '1': 'baz' }
  var arr = Array.from(arguments);
  arr.push("bam");
  console.log("List of items", arr); //  [ 'foo', 'baz', 'bam' ]
}

bar("foo", "baz");

// Array.from(..) has several powerful capabilities, and will be covered in detail in the ES6 & Beyond title in this series

/* INTO JAVASCRIPT */

// in the previous chapter, I introduced the basic building blocks of programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions
// of course, all the code shown has been in JS
// but in this chapter, we want to focus specifically on things you need to know about JS to get up and going as a JS developer
// we will introduce quite a few concepts in this chapter that will not be fully explored until subsequent YDKJS books
// you can think of this chapter as an overview of the topics covered in detail through‐out the rest of this series
// especially if you’re new to JS, you should expect to spend quite a bit of time reviewing the concepts and code examples here multiple times
// any good foundation is laid brick by brick, so don’t expect that you’ll immediately understand it all the first pass through
// your journey to deeply learn JavaScript starts here

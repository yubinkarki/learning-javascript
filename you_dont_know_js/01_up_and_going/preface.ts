/* PREFACE */

// JS has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume
// few doubt its importance at the heart of the world's most widely available software platform: the Web
// but as a language
// it has perpetually been a target for a great deal of criticism due to its design philosophy
// while JS is perhaps one of the easiest languages to get up nd running with
// its eccentricities make solid mastery of the language
// a vastly less common occurrence than in many other languages
// sophisticated concepts that are deeply rooted into the language
// tend instead to surface themselves in seemingly simplistic ways
// such as passing around functions as callbacks
// which encourages the JS developer to just the use the language as is
// and not worry too much about what's going on under the hood
// because JS can be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained
// the JS you know right now is probably
// parts handed down to you by others who've been burned by incomplete understanding
// that JS is but a shadow of the true language
// you don't really know JS yet, but if you dig into this series, you will

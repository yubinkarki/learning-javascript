/* PREFACE */

// JS has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume
// few doubt its importance at the heart of the world's most widely available software platform: the Web
// but as a language
// it has perpetually been a target for a great deal of criticism due to its design philosophy
// while JS is perhaps one of the easiest languages to get up nd running with
// its eccentricities make solid mastery of the language
// a vastly less common occurrence than in many other languages
// sophisticated concepts that are deeply rooted into the language
// tend instead to surface themselves in seemingly simplistic ways
// such as passing around functions as callbacks
// which encourages the JS developer to just the use the language as is
// and not worry too much about what's going on under the hood
// because JS can be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained
// the JS you know right now is probably
// parts handed down to you by others who've been burned by incomplete understanding
// that JS is but a shadow of the true language
// you don't really know JS yet, but if you dig into this series, you will

// i’m sure you noticed, but “JS” in the series title
// is not an abbreviation for words used to curse about JS
// though cursing at the language’s quirks is something we can probably all identify with!
// from the earliest days of the Web
// JS has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume
// while flickering mouse trails and annoying pop-up prompts may be where JS started
// nearly two decades later, the technology and capability of JS has grown many orders of magnitude
// and few doubt its importance at the heart of the world’s most widely available software platform: the Web
// but as a language, it has perpetually been a target for a great deal of criticism
// owing partly to its heritage but even more to its design philosophy
// even the name evokes, as Brendan Eich once put it, “dumb kid brother”
// status next to its more mature older brother Java
// but the name is merely an accident of politics and marketing
// the two languages are vastly different in many important ways
// “JavaScript” is as related to “Java” as “Carnival” is to “Car”
// it is simultaneously a simple, easy-to-use language that has broad appeal
// and a complex and nuanced collection of language mechanics
// that without careful study will elude true understanding even for the most seasoned of JS developers

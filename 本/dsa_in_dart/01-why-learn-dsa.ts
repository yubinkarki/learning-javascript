/* WHY LEARN DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS */

// the study of data structures is one of efficiency
// given a particular amount of data
// what is the best way to store it to achieve a particular goal?
// as a programmer, you regularly use a variety of collection types
// such as lists maps and sets
// these are data structures that hold a collection of data
// each structure having its own performance characteristics

// for example, consider the difference between a list and a set
// both are meant to hold a collection of elements
// but searching for an element in a list takes far longer than searching for an element in a set
// on the other hand, you can order the elements of a list but you can’t order the elements of a set

// data structures are a well-studied discipline, and the concepts are language agnostic
// a data structure from C is functionally and conceptually identical
// to the same data structure in any other language, such as Dart
// at the same time, the high-level expressiveness of Dart makes it an ideal choice
// for learning these core concepts without sacrificing too much performance

// algorithms, on the other hand, are a set of operations that complete a task
// this can be a sorting algorithm that moves data around to put it in order
// or it can be an algorithm that compresses an 8K picture to a manageable size
// algorithms are essential to software
// and many have been created to act as building blocks for useful programs

// using an appropriate data structure is crucial when working with lots of data
// and using the right algorithm plays a significant role
// in the performance and scalability of your software
// your mobile apps will be more responsive and have better battery life
// your server apps will be able to handle more concurrent requests and use less energy
// algorithms often include proofs of correctness that you can leverage to build better software
